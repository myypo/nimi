This is the main safety net for keeping long-running services alive, and also a guardrail to prevent tight restart loops from burning CPU. You can choose a policy that matches the reliability needs of each deployment. For development you might disable restarts entirely, while production workloads usually benefit from a bounded or always-on policy.","path":"options.html#option-settings-restart","tokens":["reliability","production","that","the","after","keeping","restart","net","restarted","alive","loops","matches","long-running","cpu","needs","deployment","development","how","this","restarts","entirely","nimi","main","guardrail","for","manager","also","choose","while","policy","and","are","they","prevent","from","benefit","control","bounded","tight","you","each","process","exit","workloads","use","burning","might","can","always-on","usually","safety","disable","services"],"title_tokens":["settings","restart","option"],"anchors":[]},{"id":"40","title":"Option: settings.restart.count","content":"Maximum number of restart attempts when is .
